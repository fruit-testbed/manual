Running

 on a Raspberry Pi
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $\fruitos$
\end_inset

 runs on a range of Raspberry Pi boards including the Pi Zero, Zero W, 1,
 2, 3, and 3B+.
 Both 32-bit and 64-bit operating system variants are supported on 64-bit
 capable boards.
 In addition, it is possible to run 
\begin_inset Formula $\fruitos$
\end_inset

 on other boards such as ((TODO)), though this is not yet a fully supported
 process.

SD card partitions and mounts in a running system
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once installed and running, 
\begin_inset Formula $\fruitos$
\end_inset

 configures your SD card to have four partitions.
 From the running system, the SD card as a whole appears as 
\family typewriter
/dev/mmcblk0
\family default
, and its partitions appear as 
\family typewriter
/dev/mmcblk0p1
\family default
 through 
\family typewriter
mmcblk0p4
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
mmcblk0p1
\family default
 is the 
\emph on
boot
\emph default
 partition, formatted as FAT32.
 It includes the standard Raspberry Pi binary blobs such as 
\family typewriter
bootcode.bin
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
start.elf
\family default
, and so on.
 However, it also includes 
\begin_inset Formula $\fruitos$
\end_inset

-specific bootloader code and control files, as detailed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "sec:The-FruitOS-boot-process"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 Its size is fixed at installation time to ((TODO)) megabytes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
mmcblk0p2
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
mmcblk0p3
\family default
 are the 
\emph on
immutable root filesystem
\emph default
 partitions, formatted as 
\family typewriter
ext4
\family default
.
 At any given time when the system is running, one of the two partitions
 is 
\emph on
active
\emph default
 and the other is 
\emph on
inactive
\emph default
.
 The boot loader alternates between the two each time the system is rebooted.
 The update process always updates the inactive partition, while running
 from the active partition.
 If one of the partitions is damaged during an update, the system will boot
 from the other and will repair the damaged partition using the content
 of the undamaged partition.
 In this way, 
\begin_inset Formula $\fruitos$
\end_inset

 is robust against certain kinds of update failure.
 Both partitions are fixed at installation time to ((TODO)) megabytes, and
 it is important that they have exactly the same number of sectors in order
 to allow the update process to work reliably.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
mmcblk0p4
\family default
 is the 
\emph on
data
\emph default
 partition, formatted as 
\family typewriter
btrfs
\family default
.
 At present, it contains two directories which are overlaid atop the active
 root filesystem, thereby allowing for persistent configuration and other
 data to automatically be brought forward across reboots and system upgrades.
 The first of the overlaid directories contains SSH key information; the
 second contains docker control and data files.
 User applications may make informal use of this partition; in future, 
\begin_inset Formula $\fruitos$
\end_inset

 will support such use in a more controlled way.
 This partition is 
\emph on
created
\emph default
 at installation time to use the entirety of the portion of the SD card
 not used by the other, fixed-size partitions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The partitions are mounted as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
/
\family default
 is an overlay filesystem, with whichever of 
\family typewriter
mmcblk0p2
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
mmcblk0p3
\family default
 is active at the bottom of the stack, a 
\family typewriter
tmpfs
\family default
 next, and then 
\family typewriter
/etc/ssh
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
/var/lib/docker
\family default
 directories from the 
\family typewriter
.etc_ssh
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
.docker
\family default
 directories of 
\family typewriter
mmcblk0p4
\family default
, respectively.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
/media/mmcblk0p1
\family default
 is a read-write mount of the boot partition.
 Various system processes update the boot code and configuration files in
 this partition from time to time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
/media/root-ro
\family default
 is a read-only mount of the active root filesystem (either 
\family typewriter
mmcblk0p2
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
mmcblk0p3
\family default
).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
/media/root-rw
\family default
 is the 
\family typewriter
tmpfs
\family default
 that is overlaid atop 
\family typewriter
root-ro
\family default
 as part of the stack making up the 
\family typewriter
/
\family default
 overlay mount.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
/media/data
\family default
 is a read-write mount of 
\family typewriter
mmcblk0p4
\family default
.
 At present, 
\begin_inset Formula $\fruitos$
\end_inset

 does not impose any structure on this portion of the filesystem, with the
 exception of the 
\family typewriter
.etc_ssh
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
.docker
\family default
 directories mentioned above.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition, for convenience, 
\family typewriter
/data
\family default
 is a symbolic link to 
\family typewriter
/media/data
\family default
.
